## How to get Pump.fun global volume accumulator and user volume accumulator account keys

On 1st August, Pump.fun buy transaction type is updated.
Not changed sell transaction.

In buy transaction, they added 2 accounts in that last of previous key array.
So we need 14 account keys for transaction.

(Important: These new 2 accounts should be writable.)

I attached 2 files - python and typescript file.
Thank you.
